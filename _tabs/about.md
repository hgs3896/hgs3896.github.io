## Motivation to My Programming

I want to be a programmer **for fun**.  
Since there are plenty of technologies over the world and thousands of fun things in this domain,  
programming just for fun can provide enough reasons for me to dive in.  

### My career

I **started programming** with **Flash Actionscript 2.0** since I was an **13-years-old boy**.  
At 14, I tried to construct a few lines of a single program written in C on my own.  
It was very difficult.  
Therefore, I started **C#** at first.  

To see more information about me, see my **[Curriculum Vitae](../cv)**.
